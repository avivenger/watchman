Advanced Features:
1. Ability to support non-continual posts (E.g, watch starts at 19:00, ceases at 23:00 and resumes at 1:00)
2. History, meaning that it will be possible to keep track on the posts each person has taken.
3. Ability to group watch lists when deciding on the time each person will save.
4. Using the history feature, making sure that no one is consistently at the same hours/posts.
5. Minimum/Maximum time per watch.
